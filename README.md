## Echos of Players Past

*Solve puzzles with the help of everyone that has played this game so far!*

This is a puzzle game in which you can summon other players who have previously completed the levels. You'll need to work together in order to get to the finish line and not accidentally kill the echos of the other players. If you beat it, hopefully you will be helpful to future players!

## Controls:

- Arrow keys / WASD: Move
- R: Restart level
- Mouse: Select one or more players to summon (depending on the level)

**NOTE: Sometimes you need to summon more than 1 player**

Only one player needs to actually complete the level, so you can still win if you're the helper that stays behind.

Every time you beat a level (either you or another player makes it to the goal), your inputs will be saved on the server. That also means each player you can summon has beaten the level with those inputs... so it should be possible to work together and beat it with them!

There's no ending screen so when the game loops back around, you've won :) Have fun!
